# Feature-Engineering-and-Polynomial-Regression
This repository contains an optional lab exploring Feature Engineering and Polynomial Regression using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The lab demonstrates how linear regression can be extended to model complex, non-linear functions by transforming input features.
